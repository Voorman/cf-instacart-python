# cf-instacart-python

Displays the jupyter notebooks and visualizations that I worked on during my Career Foundry Data Analyst Course using the sample project "instacart".

## Objective

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The objective of this study is to analyse customer behhavior and uncover patterns for growth.

- orders
- products
- departments
- customers

The full details of the data are available [here](https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b).


## Tools
For this project, the following python libraries were used:
- numpy - for working with arrays
- pandas - for data analysis
- scipy - to solve scientific and mathematical problems
- matplotlib - for visualization and graphical plotting
- seaborn - for visualization

## Executing the code
The code is available as jupyter notebooks, available under /scripts/.
