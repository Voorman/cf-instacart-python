## Tools
For this project, the following python libraries were used:
- numpy - for working with arrays
- pandas - for data analysis
- scipy - to solve scientific and mathematical problems
- matplotlib - for visualization and graphical plotting
- seaborn - for visualization

## Executing the code
The code is available as jupyter notebooks, available under /scripts/.
